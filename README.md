# Simple Dice Game Simulation

## Overview

This Python script simulates a straightforward dice game for computational thinking. The game involves rolling a six-sided die, with numbers 1, 2, and 3 signifying a game over and numbers 4, 5, and 6 determining the winnings ($4, $5, or $6). The simulation is run for 10,000 games, tracking key metrics such as the average amount won, the probability of a non-zero winning, and the largest amount won in a single game.

## How the Game Works

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Rolling 1, 2, or 3 ends the game.
   - Rolling 4, 5, or 6 determines the winnings.

2. **Simulation Details:**
   - 10,000 games are simulated. More games can be simulated by modifying the games variable. 
   - Game metrics, including average winnings, probability of non-zero winnings, and largest winnings, are tracked.

## Key Metrics

- **Probability of Non-Zero Winning:**
  - The likelihood that a game concludes with a non-zero amount.

- **Average Amount Won:**
  - The average winnings across all games that resulted in a positive outcome.

- **Largest Amount Won:**
  - The maximum winnings achieved in a single game.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script.

## Simulation Results

Upon running the simulation, the script outputs different results for each simulation

## Key Questions

1. Would you pay $3 to play the game? What about $4?
2. How likely do you think it is to win at least $4?
